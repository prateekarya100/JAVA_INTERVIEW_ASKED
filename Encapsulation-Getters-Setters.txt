Encapsulation
	=> Not providing direct access to modify private member inside a Bank Account class 
	=> Provide Getters / Setters method to modify private fields in controlled manner
	

Advantages of Encapsulation
=================================================================================================================================================================
	Data Protection: 
	 -- Encapsulation protects the internal state of an object from unintended modification by restricting direct access to its fields.

	Controlled Access: 
	 -- By providing getter and setter methods, encapsulation allows controlled access to the fields, including validation and additional logic.

	Improved Maintainability: 
         -- Encapsulation helps in isolating changes to specific parts of the code, making it easier to maintain and modify.

	Enhanced Flexibility: 
         -- The internal implementation of a class can be changed without affecting the code that uses the class, as long as the public interface remains consistent.
